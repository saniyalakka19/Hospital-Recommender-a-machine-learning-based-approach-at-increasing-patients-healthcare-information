# Thesis-Project

We created a hospital recommendation system on hospitals in the Pacific Northwest to provide information on healthcare facilities based on a patient’s personal ranked preferences of hospital features (such as: surgery, nurses, service/staff, childcare, facility, emergency room, etc.). Our system uses a machine learning clustering algorithm which matches hospitals to the patient’s specified features. The algorithms we explored are the K-means Clustering Algorithm and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. From these clusters, we were able to provide a hospital name and its location based on the user’s ranked preferences. Our goal is to help patients make informed choices regarding their health, improving health literacy and health information accessibility.
